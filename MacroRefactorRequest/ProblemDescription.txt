=====================================================================
I was contacted professionally to refactor a long used macro employed 
to facilitate essential daily operations. Position and need dependent 
changes exposed the nature and construction of the Excel VBA Macro as 
problematic. I was given the following set of guidance and nothing 
further. I reproduced the functionality of the macro through reverse 
engineering. Upon completion and submission, only minor adjustments 
were made to suit the needs of the requester.

Improve:
	- Speed
	- Extensibility
	- Readability
	- Functionality
	- Flexibility
	- Maintainability
Add:
	- Structure
	- Descriptive commentary
	- Self-Documentation (Philosophy)
	- Common Error catching/handling
	- Optional conditional functionality
Remove:
	- Unnecessary lines (recordings)
	- Reliance on Worksheet real-estate
	- Functional interdependencies
Special:
	- Create handle cases for using available application resources when available (Outlook)
	- Fix issue in attachment creation wherein resources not released after execution
