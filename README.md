# VBAmodules
A brief and incomplete list of misc. VBA modules I have distributed.
Showcased here to highlight my familiarity and expertise with the
language and platform.

In each directory in VbaHelpingReddit there is a file titled
ProblemDescription.txt containing a link to the original post on the
r/VBA subreddit and the details of the post. All other files in these
directories are the solutions I submitted.

The files in MacroRefactorRequest are from a recent professional
request fullfilled. It too has a ProblemDescription.txt

Files in Nand2Tetris contain a Hack Assembly Language to Hack Machine
Language Assembler wrtten in VBA, a test .asm file and it's resulting
.hack file, and a ProblemDescription.txt file. The VBA assembler is
an optional (harder) method to pass the Nand2Tetris Part 1 final,
Project 6. Details can be found in the ProblemDescription.txt file.
