[Excel] Application.PrintCommunication different results

=====================================================================
My vba-project shall put imported data into a certain format prior printing.

I just added to it, same data should be copyed in a different format on a 
second worksheet in the same file. Copied and adapted most of my code for 
that. When it comes to pageformat and printarea, I run into bugs.

Table 1 shall be portrait A4, via macrorecorder (or maybe googled it) I 
came to this code, which has been running fine for months now:

 Application.PrintCommunication = False
    With ActiveSheet.PageSetup
         .PrintTitleRows ="$1:$2"
         .PrintTitleColumns = ""
    End With
 Application.PrintCommunication = True
 ActiveSheet.PageSetup.PrintArea = ""
 Application.PrintCommunication = False
    With                                 'many stuff here, important right now: 
         .Orientation = xlPortrait
         .FitToPagesWide = 1
         .FitToPagesTall = 0
Sorry, on mobile app. /Edit on PC for readability.

When I run debug step for step, I always get an error at

.FitToPagesWide = 1

it expects value between 10 to 400, which is bonkers. Minimum of 10 pages
 wide...?? But running the whole script, that's always fine/works anyway 
without any prompt. Why?

But the main problem, which can't be ignored: this part still runs fine
 and has done so for months now, further down in the second half of the 
script (after changing the ActiveSheet to table2, which shall be landscape) 
I have the exact same code 'except to two adaptations, but get an error at 
a copypasted line which worked fine just 50 lines above in the same script:

 Application.PrintCommunication = False
    With ActiveSheet.PageSetup
         .PrintTitleRows ="$1:$1"      'shorter title, so just 1 row
         .PrintTitleColumns = ""
    End With
 Application.PrintCommunication = True 'error 1004, "failed method to object"
 ActiveSheet.PageSetup.PrintArea = ""
 Application.PrintCommunication = False
    With                               '... stuff, thereof 
         .Orientation = xlLandscape    'obviously
         .FitToPagesWide = 1
         .FitToPagesTall = 0
I don't even understand what the falses and trues of PrintCommunication are 
supposed to do here. I guess many commandlines could just be removed and it 
would still work. I just want the pagebreaks to fit the UsedRange and that 
to fit 1 page wide and as many pages tall as needed - which worked just fine 
until I literally copied the macro for the second Worksheet.

Any help is welcome. Thank you.
