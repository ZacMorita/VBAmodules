Number in excel copy and pasted to word doc

=====================================================================
Background,

90% of my job is financial analysis through inputting financials into 
a very large excel spread sheet, and then writing about YoY or QoQ changes 
with respects to their results and ratios.

I am trying to create a macro that will copy the needed information (key 
numbers, basic calculations, changes, %s etc.) from the excel document, 
create a new word document, and then place them into a basic template I 
will setup. If it is relevant, all the numbers are coded as "Accounting", 
"Number", "Percentage", or "Custom"

For example, if in cell "L5" is Company X's 2021 revenue of $100MM, and 
in cell "M5" is their 2022 revenue of $105MM, after executing my macro 
it will create a sentence on the word document such as "Revenues changed
by 5% from $100MM to $105MM" (I will eventually change this to an if function
 and replace "change" with increase/decrease depending on the value of M5/L5 
but want to complete this first, any tips would be appreciated)

My current code:
'Late Binding
Sub CreateWordDocUsing()
Dim WordApp As Object
Set WordApp = CreateObject("word.application")
With WordApp
.Visible = True
.Activate
.Documents.Add
'A blank word document is created as per here
With .Selection
.Font.Size = 9
.Font.Name = "Arial"
.Typetext "Revenues changed by [{(M5/L5)-1}] from [{L5}] to [{M5}]"
.TypeParagraph
.Typetext "COGS went from"...
End With
End With
End Sub
--
So I am a confused about the code that copies the number from the excel 
sheet and inputs them in between the text string (inputting the "L5, M5" 
numbers above).

I've been experimenting with inputting the code below, but I can't get 
it to work.

Dim Copysheet As Worksheet
Dim Pastesheet As This.Word.Document
-
.Copysheet.Range("L5:L5").Copy
.Pastesheet.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues

Does anyone have any suggestions or comments? Do I need to use the above 
and specify the name of the word document in the code? Was hoping to 
avoid that
