dd.mm.yy text to dd/mm/yyyy

The short story to my issue is we have an excel sheet at work where our office staff input expiry dates 
into an excel sheet and it then gets copied via vba codes over to a different excel spreadsheet for us 
guys in the factory where we can use batch numbers etc. However, if the expiry date has expired, then 
the date should not show up on our spreadsheet - this flags up that we shouldn’t be using the product 
in the factory in short terms.

However, here is the problem. The office staff keep entering expiry dates as “dd.mm.yyyy” on their 
sheet and our factory spreadsheet does not recognise this as a date. So I’m trying to find a vba code 
where, when the office staff input dd.mm.yyyy once they hit submit it will automatically change this 
text to dd/mm/yyyy.. does anyone what the vba code would be?
