How do I make it so only one cell per column is counted?

=====================================================================
Public Sub CountColorCells() 'Variable declaration Dim rng As Range Dim 
lColorCounter As Long Dim rngCell As Range Dim ws As Worksheet

    'Set the range
Set rng = Sheet2.Range("B11:AB16")

'loop throught each column in the range
For i = 1 To rng.Columns.Count
    'Check the first cell in the column for the color
    If rng.Cells(1, i).DisplayFormat.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 199, 206) Then
        lColorCounter = lColorCounter + 1
    End If
Next
'Display the value in cell F21
Sheet2.Range("F21") = lColorCounter
End Sub

I need this to check every cell in the range NOT just the first cell in 
the column. But I only want it to count 1 per column if the color is 
present. Also if I wanted to use Multiple user defined name ranges how 
would that look?

This is my first time using VBA so no judging lol.
